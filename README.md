# ImageRehoster

In this small project I used Python with the Django Framework to create a small web app that allows the user to input URLs. The app validates whether the URL belongs to an image or not. After that it stores the image into the local server and crops the image to generate a thumbnail.Finally the user can see all the stored images in the server or search for a particular one by its name.
